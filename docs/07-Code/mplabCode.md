## **Overview**
After creating the schematic and manufacturing the PCB we now have the opprotunity to code. For that we are going to use MPLAB X V5.45. It can be found as ["a zip file for individual verification"](supplied/Dirks_SubSystem.zip) and as it stands we have a ["complete system code version."](supplied/Dirks_SubSystem_complete.zip)
