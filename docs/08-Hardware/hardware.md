## **Alterations Looking Forward**

While for some the schematic can appear confusing, we can use that as a starting point for things that might be done differently. As one of the major issues during testing was ensuring that the Op-amp worked as it was designed. This was because the teaching team for 304 works better with a pictographic representation of the Op-amp. Unfortunately, this would have also increased complexity in the pcb and therefore, increased the likely hood of footprints not matching real parts.
