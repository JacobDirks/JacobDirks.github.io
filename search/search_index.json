Two power levels are required which can be derived from the same 9v 3a power supply. This can supply power to both the motor at 12v levels (combined at the H-Bridge #FAN8100N) and the second power level is a 5v 1a which is obtained through the Voltage regulator (#L7805CV). This allows the Curiosity Nano to function at its desired power levels. This also enables sensing from the two limit switches (463093691402) and the capacitive sensor due to their operating ranges. Finally the h-Bridge, part number aforementioned, controls the motor (711) which will help keep the capacitive sensor safe when not actively reading values. Otherwise Pins that are being utilized help the curiosity nano communicate with the central hub nano for this team project.</p> <p>Parts List for sensors and actuators that are involved in the diagram.

The BestCH 9V 3A AC Adapter works the best of the two devices following this form factor. A bonus fact is that the team knows the process to connect it safely to the Micro-controller and various components. This provides ample power for everything within the circuit and doesn't require us to ramp voltage up through another means to power the most voltage intensive elements. The cost being lower than the other two options is a positive but not a critically deciding factor as there are other power supply options that are around the same price point.</p>","tags":["tag1","tag2"]},{"location":"02-Component-Selection/Component-Selection/#limit-switch","title":"Limit Switch","text":"<ol> <li> <p>Switch Tactile SPST-NO 0.05A 12V</p> <p></p> <ul> <li>$0.10/each</li> <li>TS02-66-60-BK-160-LCR-D</li> </ul> Pros Cons Small outline Not easily mounted Doesn\u2019t require a lot of power Could require a secondary breadboard area to mount Signals can be in parallel Small sensing area More force than a traditional limit switch Hard to see limit is found Target surface may move without mechanical support </li> <li> <p>Switch Snap Action SPDT</p> <p></p> <ul> <li>$1.35/each</li> <li>MS0850502F030P1A</li> </ul> Pros Cons Through hole mounting Relatively large Doesn\u2019t need PCB connection directly (can wire connect) Needs support if at the end of actuator range Three states, but only two pins required Acts parallel to placement 50k+ operation lifespan </li> <li> <p>Limit Switch SPDT 3A 125V</p> <p></p> <ul> <li>$4.00/each</li> <li>463093691402</li> </ul> Pros Cons Thinner than other options Bent pin mounts Circle likely catches movement better than straight bar Pin connection extends past part width Can be mounted away from PCB Three states, but only two pins required Through hole mounting </li> </ol> <p>Choice: Option 3: Limit Switch SPDT 3A 125V</p> <p>Rationale: This limit switch is rated for the maximum power supply current and for a higher voltage than the project will be using. It's useful in ensuring the motor doesn't go too far and making it so the moisture sensor won't corrode by being in the soil for long periods of time. This particular option is better than the rest due to the smaller size and mounting options. Since it is smaller we won't need as powerful a motor to move the prismatic joint and other components at the end toward the plant. Secondarily, the cylindrical element at the end can create a depression in the soil which will have even more resistance to being moved and will help the actuation of the switch part of the component.</p>","tags":["tag1","tag2"]},{"location":"02-Component-Selection/Component-Selection/#motor-driver","title":"Motor Driver","text":"<ol> <li> <p>Brush DC Motor Controller</p> <p></p> <ul> <li>$0.96/each</li> <li>FAN8100N</li> </ul> Pros Cons Known specs for size, power, and pins Cannot modify pin positions.

It doesn't hurt that there is a secondary integrated circuit for potential mishaps. Also the unique footprint of the through-hole option helps create an easier design assembly. As an added benefit the team knows how to use this particular component in order to drive a similar motor which will help in testing the overall system. It also removes a limit on the potential motor options and if the motor chosen later doesn't require one then we can change to Option 2. (Spoiler the motor chosen uses this.)</p>","tags":["tag1","tag2"]},{"location":"02-Component-Selection/Component-Selection/#voltage-regulator","title":"Voltage Regulator","text":"<ol> <li> <p>Resistors in series</p> <p></p> <ul> <li>Price: N/A given unspecified resistor choices</li> <li>Potential Resistor Selection kit for reference</li> </ul> Pros Cons Can limit voltage Voltage output varies with current draw Parallel configuration can alter current Cannot change current and voltage simultaneously Compact placement near PCB face Requires more space than regulators Fault-tolerant due to redundancy Troubleshooting is difficult </li> <li> <p>Linear Voltage Regulator IC Positive Fixed 1 Output</p> <p></p> <ul> <li>$0.50/each</li> <li>L7805CV</li> </ul> Pros Cons Already provided Limited to 1.5A current (some needs are 3A) Well-understood by team Requires planning for voltage output Supports additional heat-sinks Can't automatically adjust input to 5V output Example circuit available Tested across various circuits </li> <li> <p>Buck Boost Switching Regulator IC Positive or Negative Adjustable</p> <p></p> <ul> <li>$0.72/each</li> <li>MC34063ADR</li> </ul> Pros Cons Adjustable output voltage Max current output is 1.5A Wide input range (3V\u201340V) Currently unfamiliar to team Design equations provided Larger footprint than L7805CV Can be surface or through-hole mounted </li> </ol> <p>Choice: Option 2: Linear Voltage Regulator IC Positive Fixed 1 Output</p> <p>Rationale: A linear voltage regulator is a clean solution to help get the power down from a higher voltage and amperage to the voltage we need for parts of this sub-system. In turn this one allows for an additional heat sink attachment if required to help prevent dangerous conditions and enable long-term use. While the price point isn't that much different from a switching regulator the ease of integration into the circuit elevates this option over the others. Also the consistency of this option promotes it over using a line of resistors.</p>","tags":["tag1","tag2"]},{"location":"02-Component-Selection/Component-Selection/#barrel-jack","title":"Barrel Jack","text":"<ol> <li> <p>Cable Assembly 2.1mm ID, 5.5mm OD Jack to Wire Leads</p> <p></p> <ul> <li>$3.12/each</li> <li>10-02248</li> </ul> Pros Cons Matches power supply output port Amorphous shape makes secure mounting difficult Could be sealed for water resistance Hard to diagnose wire issues Variable footprint flexibility Only one ground contact </li> <li> <p>Power Barrel Connector Jack 2.00mm ID (0.079\"), 5.50mm OD (0.217\") Through Hole, Right Angle</p> <p></p> <ul> <li>$0.76/each</li> <li>PJ-102AH</li> </ul> Pros Cons Stable footprint Difficult to waterproof 3 contacts from 2 conductors No built-in protection Through-hole mounted Pins fragile until PCB-mounted Matches supply ports Rated for 24V/5A </li> <li> <p>PJ-044BH - butt pins</p> <p></p> <ul> <li>$5.96/each</li> <li>PJ-044BH</li> </ul> Pros Cons Pins positioned at rear Internal exposure if seal is broken Matches supply output port No electrical protection 3 contacts from 2 conductors Needs firm PCB mounting Through-hole attachment Rated for 24V/5A </li> </ol> <p>Choice: Option 2: Power Barrel Connector Jack 2.00mm ID (0.079\"), 5.50mm OD (0.217\") Through Hole, Right Angle</p> <p>Rationale: A barrel jack is a good input due to the form factor of the power supply. However, the right angle of the pins allows us to at least create some form of security for the board as well as offer mechanical stability. Otherwise the footprint is distinct which will help in identifying its location on the board. Since it is a hard mechanical component we don't have to worry about it being taken out of the housing or tearing lose from the soldered ends as easily as the amorphous solution. Also due to the pins being perpendicular to the force of the plug being inserted or extracted we know that the solder won't get pulled on its thinnest surface area.</p>","tags":["tag1","tag2"]},{"location":"02-Component-Selection/Component-Selection/#motor","title":"Motor","text":"<ol> <li> <p>DC Motor Gearmotor 251 RPM Incremental</p> <p></p> <ul> <li>$16.50/each</li> <li>FIT0186</li> </ul> Pros Cons High stall current &amp; Max Operating voltage Requires several control pins Includes encoder Software control needed, not easy to simulate No external software for encoder needed Hard to secure due to cylindrical shape </li> <li> <p>DC Motor Standard 9100 RPM 6VDC</p> <p></p> <ul> <li>$1.95/each</li> <li>711</li> </ul> Pros Cons Works with predefined track No position feedback Flat side helps control torque output Requires external bound control Compact, easy to secure Rated 4.5\u20139V, slightly over 5V limit Lightweight Lower torque Mechanically simulative Flexible mounting options </li> <li> <p>Positional Rotation DC Motor Servomotor, RC (Hobby) Incremental 4.8VDC</p> <p></p> <ul> <li>$3.62/each</li> <li>SER0006</li> </ul> Pros Cons Rectangular shape for better torque transfer Requires homing and configuration Has incremental encoder Needs PWM (extra wire) Rated at 4.8V DC Cannot be simulated mechanically High torque No motor controller needed </li> </ol> <p>Choice: Option 2: DC Motor Standard 9100 RPM 6VDC</p> <p>Rationale: While it does have a lowered torque this acts as a safety feature for both the user and the plant in case the moisture sensor is misaligned. Also the flat sides on the housing of the motor allow for a brace to be installed in order to ensure the motor doesn't just spin. An added benefit of not having an encoder is a reduction in the wires that need to be connected directly to the motor. Reducing the amount of wires that would be exposed to the user's environment and needed to be searched to debug errors with the motor. Its size also helps the keep the housing smaller and doesn't force the team to come up with a clever way to hide it or to prevent damage over a larger surface.</p>","tags":["tag1","tag2"]},{"location":"02-Component-Selection/Component-Selection/#moisture-sensor","title":"Moisture Sensor","text":"<ol> <li> <p>Handmade Resistive check using nails</p> <ul> <li>Item is not commercially available.</li> </ul> Pros Cons No daughter board needed Materials degrade over time Easy soil removal Readings may be biased by soil chemistry Reading handled in software Very dry soil might not register Modular parts for easy repair Theoretical op-amp dependence unclear </li> <li> <p>Moisture Sensor Evaluation Board</p> </li> </ol> <p></p> <ul> <li>$7.95/each</li> <li>13637</li> </ul> Pros Cons Easy to extend to probe Is a daughter board \u2013 violates requirements Prebuilt, screw terminals Large probes can harm plants Consumer-friendly design potential Logic integration reduces student learning opportunity Reaches deeper into soil <ol> <li>VH400 Soil Moisture Sensor</li> </ol> <p></p> <ul> <li>$44.95/each</li> <li>VH400</li> </ul> Pros Cons Wide input voltage range Likely includes daughter board (violation) Low current use (&lt;13mA) Probe may not fit pots or harm roots Quick sampling (can be toggled on/off) Not available from reputable sellers Unaffected by salt/fertilizer Usable in hydroponics Long-lasting corrosion-resistant design <p>Choice: Option 1: Handmade resistive check using nails</p> <p>Rationale: This option forces the student team to delve into how electricity is transferred through space.
